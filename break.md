## break the cycle

- it is said that in order to achive something you've never achieved before, you must be willing to do something you've not done before.

- often times i get to this point and just when i'm beggining to believe in hope and change, all something always happens and takes me back to the place i was originally, something even at a place worse than where I was originally, how do i break this cycle?
